**#Ambulance Patrol Drone System**
A comprehensive emergency medical response system that combines drone technology with real-time video streaming to provide faster emergency response and enable remote medical professionals to assess situations before the ambulance arrives.

**🚀 Features**
Real-time Drone Simulation: Interactive map interface for drone operators

Doctor Monitoring Interface: Real-time video feed and patient monitoring

Live GPS Tracking: Synchronized location data between drone and doctor interfaces

Video Conferencing: Integrated ZegoCloud video calls for emergency consultations

Traffic Navigation: Advanced routing algorithms for efficient emergency response

Multi-device Support: Accessible from multiple devices simultaneously

**🏥 System Architecture**
The system consists of three main components:

Main Portal (index.html): Landing page with connection management

Drone Interface (drone.html): Operator control panel with map and simulation

Doctor Interface (doctor.html): Medical professional monitoring dashboard

**🛠️ Technology Stack**
Frontend: HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript (ES6+)

Mapping: Leaflet.js with OpenStreetMap tiles

Real-time Communication: Socket.IO

Video Conferencing: ZegoCloud SDK

Backend: Node.js, Express.js

Deployment: Render.com

**📋 Prerequisites**
Node.js (v14 or higher)

npm or yarn package manager

Modern web browser with WebRTC support

**🚀 Installation & Setup**
1.Clone the repository
bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd testfile6

2.Install dependencies
bash
npm install

3.Configure environment variables
Create a .env file in the root directory:
text
PORT=8003
